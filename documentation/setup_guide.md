Certainly! Here are the step-by-step instructions to clone the GitHub repository and set up the project with Poetry for dependencies on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

### Cloning the GitHub Repository:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeancheri/emergency-dept-optimization.git
   ```

4. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd emergency-dept-optimization
   ```

### Setting up Poetry for Dependencies:

#### For Windows:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory (`emergency-dept-optimization`).

3. Install Poetry by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

4. Once Poetry is installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

5. Poetry will create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

6. After installation, you can activate the virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

7. You are now ready to use the project. You can run scripts or execute commands within the virtual environment.

#### For macOS and Linux:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Most macOS and Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory (`emergency-dept-optimization`).

3. Install Poetry by running the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

   This command will download and install Poetry on your system.

4. Once Poetry is installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

5. Poetry will create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

6. After installation, you can activate the virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

7. You are now ready to use the project. You can run scripts or execute commands within the virtual environment.

### Starting to Use the Project:

After completing the setup steps, you can start using the project by running scripts, executing commands, or launching applications as per the project's requirements. Ensure that you are working within the virtual environment created by Poetry to ensure isolation and dependency management.
